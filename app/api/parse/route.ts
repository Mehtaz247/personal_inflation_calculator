Extract the monthly spending amounts (in INR) from the following text and map them to the appropriate categories.
Also infer location and area type when the user mentions them.
Return ONLY valid JSON matching the schema.

Spending categories (all amounts in INR per month):
- food: Groceries, vegetables, dairy, beverages cooked at home — for a
  vegetarian household this is the entire food bill; for a non-vegetarian
  household this is everything OTHER than meat and fish (cereals, dairy,
  vegetables, fruits, oils, etc.).
- food_meat: Chicken, mutton, beef, pork — fresh, chilled or frozen meat
  & poultry. Only emit when the user is non-vegetarian and gives an
  explicit amount or proportion for meat/poultry.
- food_seafood: Fish, prawns, crab, other seafood. Only emit when the
  user is non-vegetarian and mentions fish/seafood spend.
- eating_out: Restaurants, cafes, food delivery, hotels
- housing: Rent (incl. imputed rent if owned), water, electricity, cooking gas
- transport: Vehicle fuel (petrol/diesel), public transport, taxi, vehicle upkeep
- communication: Mobile, broadband, internet, postal
- healthcare: Medicines, doctor fees, hospitals, insurance
- education: School/college fees, books, tuitions
- clothing: Apparel, footwear, tailoring
- household_personal: Furnishings, toiletries, grooming
- entertainment: Movies, OTT, sports, hobbies, events
- tobacco_alcohol: Paan, tobacco, intoxicants

Location:
- state: Map any city or state mentioned to its Indian state/UT name. Use one of:
  ${STATE_NAMES.join(", ")}.
  Examples: "Bangalore" or "Bengaluru" → "Karnataka"; "Mumbai" or "Pune" → "Maharashtra";
  "Delhi" or "Gurgaon-side Delhi NCR" → "NCT of Delhi"; "Hyderabad" → "Telangana";
  "Chennai" → "Tamil Nadu"; "Ahmedabad" or "Surat" → "Gujarat".
  Omit if no location is mentioned.
- sector: REQUIRED to be one of exactly three values: "urban", "rural", or "combined"
  (combined = Urban + Rural blended). Pick the single best fit:
    • "urban"    → user clearly lives in a city/town/metro (e.g. "Mumbai", "Bangalore",
                   "I work in an office in Gurgaon").
    • "rural"    → user explicitly mentions a village, farm, or rural setting as
                   their primary residence.
    • "combined" → user mentions a state/UT without specifying urban-vs-rural, OR
                   their situation is genuinely mixed (e.g. "we split time between
                   our farm and our flat in the city"), OR no location signal at all.
  Always emit one of these three values — do NOT omit the field.

Diet:
- diet: "veg" or "non-veg". Set "non-veg" if the user mentions eating
  meat, chicken, mutton, beef, pork, fish, seafood, prawns, eggs, or
  describes themselves as non-vegetarian. Otherwise default to "veg".
  When diet is "non-veg" and the user gives a single combined "food"
  amount with no breakdown, you may make a sensible split: roughly 70%
  to `food`, 20% to `food_meat`, 10% to `food_seafood` for a typical
  Indian non-veg household — but only if the user clearly signals they
  eat both meat and fish. If they only mention meat OR fish, skip the
  other field.

If a spending category is not mentioned, omit it or set it to 0. Only output the JSON object.
