Extract the monthly spending amounts (in INR) from the following text and map them to the appropriate categories.
Also infer location and area type when the user mentions them.
Return ONLY valid JSON matching the schema.

Spending categories (all amounts in INR per month):
- food: Groceries, vegetables, dairy, beverages cooked at home — for a
  vegetarian household this is the entire food bill; for a non-vegetarian
  household this is everything OTHER than meat and fish (cereals, dairy,
  vegetables, fruits, oils, etc.).
- food_meat: Chicken, mutton, beef, pork — fresh, chilled or frozen meat
  & poultry. Only emit when the user is non-vegetarian and gives an
  explicit amount or proportion for meat/poultry.
- food_seafood: Fish, prawns, crab, other seafood. Only emit when the
  user is non-vegetarian and mentions fish/seafood spend.
- eating_out: Restaurants, cafes, dhabas, food delivery, hotels (MoSPI div 11)
- housing: Rent (incl. imputed rent if owned), water, electricity, cooking gas (div 04)
- furnishings: Furniture, home appliances, cleaning products, domestic help (div 05)
- transport: Vehicle fuel (petrol/diesel), public transport, taxi, vehicle upkeep (div 07)
- communication: Mobile, broadband, internet, postal services (div 08)
- healthcare: Medicines, doctor fees, hospitals, insurance (div 06)
- education: School/college fees, books, tuitions (div 10)
- clothing: Apparel, footwear, tailoring (div 03)
- personal_care: Toiletries, grooming, haircuts, hygiene, personal-care services (div 12)
- recreation: OTT, movies, sports, hobbies, books, cultural events (div 09)
- tobacco_alcohol: Paan, cigarettes, bidi, tobacco, alcohol, intoxicants (div 02)

Location:
- state: Map any city or state mentioned to its Indian state/UT name. Use one of:
  ${STATE_NAMES.join(", ")}.
  Examples: "Bangalore" or "Bengaluru" → "Karnataka"; "Mumbai" or "Pune" → "Maharashtra";
  "Delhi" or "Gurgaon-side Delhi NCR" → "NCT of Delhi"; "Hyderabad" → "Telangana";
  "Chennai" → "Tamil Nadu"; "Ahmedabad" or "Surat" → "Gujarat".
  Omit if no location is mentioned.
- sector: REQUIRED to be one of exactly three values: "urban", "rural", or "combined"
  (combined = Urban + Rural blended). Pick the single best fit:
    • "urban"    → user clearly lives in a city/town/metro (e.g. "Mumbai", "Bangalore",
                   "I work in an office in Gurgaon").
    • "rural"    → user explicitly mentions a village, farm, or rural setting as
                   their primary residence.
    • "combined" → user mentions a state/UT without specifying urban-vs-rural, OR
                   their situation is genuinely mixed (e.g. "we split time between
                   our farm and our flat in the city"), OR no location signal at all.
  Always emit one of these three values — do NOT omit the field.

Diet:
- diet: "veg" or "non-veg". Set "non-veg" if the user mentions eating
  meat, chicken, mutton, beef, pork, fish, seafood, prawns, eggs, or
  describes themselves as non-vegetarian. Otherwise default to "veg".
  When diet is "non-veg" and the user gives a single combined "food"
  amount with no breakdown, you may make a sensible split: roughly 70%
  to food, 20% to food_meat, 10% to food_seafood for a typical
  Indian non-veg household — but only if the user clearly signals they
  eat both meat and fish. If they only mention meat OR fish, skip the
  other field.

Estimation when numbers are missing:
- The user is describing their lifestyle. They will often give qualitative cues
  (city, profession, family size, type of housing, vehicle, eating-out habits,
  hobbies, dependents, schooling, etc.) WITHOUT explicit rupee amounts.
- In that case, you MUST still produce a plausible monthly INR estimate for
  every category that fits their described lifestyle — do not leave the basket
  empty just because numbers are missing. Use Indian middle-class norms as a
  baseline and adjust up or down using every signal in the text:
    • Tier-1 metro (Mumbai/Bangalore/Delhi/Hyderabad/Pune/Chennai) → higher
      housing, transport, eating_out, recreation than a tier-2/3 town.
    • Family size: a couple with two kids spends more on food, education,
      healthcare, clothing than a single working professional.
    • Lifestyle markers: "luxury", "frugal", "student", "retired", "startup
      founder", "homemaker", "owns a car", "uses metro", "orders Swiggy daily",
      "cooks at home", "sends kids to private school" should all materially
      shift the relevant categories.
    • Owned home vs. renting: imputed rent is usually lower than market rent.
- Use the explicit numbers the user DOES give as anchors and scale the estimated
  categories around them so the total feels coherent (e.g. someone paying ₹80k
  rent in Mumbai is unlikely to spend only ₹2k on groceries).
- It is fine — and expected — to fabricate reasonable numbers for unmentioned
  categories. The goal is a complete, realistic monthly basket, not literal
  transcription. Do not output 0 for a category unless the user clearly said
  they spend nothing on it (e.g. "I don't drink or smoke" → tobacco_alcohol: 0).
- Only omit a category entirely if it genuinely does not apply (e.g.
  food_meat / food_seafood for a vegetarian, education for a single person
  with no dependents).

Only output the JSON object.
